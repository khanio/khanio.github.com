Summary: This post is a follow-up of my recent talk on same topic at the Big Data Kuala Lumpur User Group August 2013 meetup at F-Secure Malaysia office. It covers basic understanding of Amazon Web Services and its components, Amazon EMR in particular and concludes with tips from a Solution Architect's prospective.
