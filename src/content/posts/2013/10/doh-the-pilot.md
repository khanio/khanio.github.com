About a year back, on a weekend I started thinking about web identity, i.e how am I structured on web. With the increasing number of apps and sevices I signed up with, it was hard to keep track of my own web persona. And eventually I realized, my identity on web was very confusing to myself. Over a period of time I had used different nomenclature/schemes for usernames, passwords and website titles. And the very simple question "About Me", was never the same on different web properties. I knew this was not right. So the first action I had to take was to define myself, what matters most to me, who am I and how much of worth would all this be to the audience.

After jotting down my attributes and interests, it was clear to me that my ability to realize ideas into products and the never dying entrepreneurial instinct, were the two traits that defined me. And so the answer to 'About Me' field turned out to be 'Just trying to independently...', which was taken from a Bloomberg's documentary on Michael Burry. I could pretty much relate every attribute about myself with this statement. And I didn't shy away from not been original, as I am not an artist but more of an opportunist.

With the basic definition about me out of the way, it was turn to find a right naming scheme, which would be apt for usernames and web site domain name. Earlier I used to blog, for which the domain was thepixelcode.com, and due to a foolish mistake of mine, I lost the source code and access to the hosting server, lesson learnt was not to rely on cheap third party services for core stuff. After tinkering a bit with prefixes and suffixes, I found 'khanio.com' to be available. The basic fundamental of computer science engineering is the ability to operate on a set of inputs and deliver the required set of output based on a defined procedure. So hence I/O for Input/Output got added to my surname*.

Few months later in April 2013, the design was done and the required markup generated, I opted to use GitHub for hosting my static website and the source code. And once this was done, I made to a promise to myself, that I woudld make sure to write weekly about stuff that matters to me.

Fast forward again to current time, and you will realize that I haven't kept the promise to myself. which made me think agian, why did I take all the efforts then, if this was my commitment to the asset. I could easily blame my work and travel schedule, or my weekend projects, but that was not the real problem. The problem was with my ability to sit in from of a text editor and type. Writing is a very thought provoking process and many a times, I would start on certain topic and would end up thinking or exploring something else. Impluses would override me.

Yes, me and Homer Simpson have something in common, we are just not foolish but we are completely ruled by our impulses, headfirst into every single impulsive thought that occurs to us. And the only way I could revive and keep up to my commitment was I choose a different strategy. Instead of starting with a blank page and do nothing, I decided I would record audio notes for my self reference whenever I can find time on weekdays, and consolidate them into a note on a weekend, which I can later reason. Sharing these thoughts with you, is not for exhibition purpose but more for self-healing, I wanted to clean up my closet and sort out the events that occured in my life and reason them with you. Your feedback would defintely help me develop the context further. So looking forward to connect. Cheers.
